# Node Modules Disk Space Calculator

A command-line tool to analyze and manage disk space used by `node_modules` directories across your development folders. It helps you identify space-consuming node_modules folders and optionally clean up unused ones.

## Features

- üìä Calculates total disk space used by all `node_modules` directories
- üîç Supports scanning multiple directories simultaneously
- üö´ Skip specific directories using `skip.txt`
- üóëÔ∏è Selectively empty directories using `delete.txt`
- üíæ Shows human-readable file sizes
- üîí Safe handling of symbolic links
- ‚ö° Confirms before any deletion operations

## Installation

1. Save the script as `calculate-node-modules.js`
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed
3. No additional dependencies required

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
node calculate-node-modules.js

# Scan specific directory
node calculate-node-modules.js /path/to/projects

# Scan multiple directories
node calculate-node-modules.js /path/to/projects ~/personal-projects /opt/work
```

## Configuration Files

### skip.txt

Create a `skip.txt` file in the same directory as the script to specify directories to skip. Each line should contain one directory path:

```txt
# Comments start with #
/Users/me/important-project
/Users/me/client-work
./relative/path/to/skip
```

### delete.txt

Create a `delete.txt` file to specify which `node_modules` directories should be emptied when using the `--delete` flag:

```txt
# Comments start with #
/Users/me/old-projects
/Users/me/test-projects
```

## Delete Mode

To empty directories specified in `delete.txt`:

1. Create a `delete.txt` file with directories to clean
2. Run the script with the `--delete` flag:
   ```bash
   node calculate-node-modules.js --delete /path/to/scan
   ```
3. Review the directories to be emptied
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

The script will:
- Show size of each directory before deletion
- Report space freed for each emptied directory
- Display total space freed
- Skip any directories listed in `skip.txt`

## Safety Features

- Never follows symbolic links
- Requires explicit `--delete` flag for deletions
- Interactive confirmation before any deletion
- Respects `skip.txt` even during deletion
- Error handling for inaccessible directories

## Example Output

Regular scan:
```
Searching for node_modules directories in:
- /Users/me/projects

Found node_modules directories:
/Users/me/projects/app1/node_modules: 234.56 MB
/Users/me/projects/app2/node_modules: 156.78 MB

Total size of all node_modules: 391.34 MB
Number of node_modules directories found: 2
```

Delete mode:
```
Searching for node_modules directories in:
- /Users/me/old-projects

WARNING: The following folders will be emptied:
- /Users/me/old-projects/app1/node_modules
- /Users/me/old-projects/app2/node_modules

Are you sure you want to proceed? (yes/no): yes

Emptying directories...
Freed up 234.56 MB from /Users/me/old-projects/app1/node_modules
Freed up 156.78 MB from /Users/me/old-projects/app2/node_modules

Total space freed: 391.34 MB
Finished emptying directories
```

## Tips

- Use absolute paths in `skip.txt` and `delete.txt` for more reliable matching
- Always check the output before confirming deletion
- Use `skip.txt` to protect important projects from accidental deletion
- Run without `--delete` first to review space usage before cleaning

## Warning

‚ö†Ô∏è Deletion operations are irreversible. Always ensure your important files are backed up before using the delete functionality.
